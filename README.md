# WARNING

**This branch is a full, incompatible, rewrite of `nvim-treesitter` and work in progress; the contents of this README are not accurate. See https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/4767.**

**This branch REQUIRES (the latest commit on) Neovim `master`.**

The goal of `nvim-treesitter` is both to provide a simple and easy way to use the interface for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) in Neovim and to provide some basic functionality such as highlighting based on it:

![example-cpp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2361214/202753610-e923bf4e-e88f-494b-bb1e-d22a7688446f.png)

Traditional highlighting (left) vs Treesitter-based highlighting (right).
More examples can be found in [our gallery](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/wiki/Gallery).

**Warning: Treesitter and nvim-treesitter highlighting are an experimental feature of Neovim.
Please consider the experience with this plug-in as experimental until Tree-Sitter support in Neovim is stable!
We recommend using the nightly builds of Neovim if possible.
You can find the current roadmap [here](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/projects/1).
The roadmap and all features of this plugin are open to change, and any suggestion will be highly appreciated!**

Nvim-treesitter is based on three interlocking features: [**language parsers**](#language-parsers), [**queries**](#adding-queries), and [**modules**](#available-modules), where _modules_ provide features – e.g., highlighting – based on _queries_ for syntax objects extracted from a given buffer by _language parsers_.
Users will generally only need to interact with parsers and modules as explained in the next section.
For more detailed information on setting these up, see ["Advanced setup"](#advanced-setup).

# Quickstart

## Requirements

- [Latest](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) Neovim release ([nightly](https://github.com/neovim/neovim#install-from-source) recommended)
- `tar` and `curl` in your path (or alternatively `git`)
- A C compiler in your path and libstdc++ installed ([Windows users please read this!](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/wiki/Windows-support)).

## Installation

You can install `nvim-treesitter` with your favorite package manager (or using the native `package` feature of vim, see `:h packages`).

**NOTE: This plugin is only guaranteed to work with specific versions of language parsers** (as specified in the `lockfile.json`). **When upgrading the plugin, you must make sure that all installed parsers are updated to the latest version** via `:TSUpdate`.
It is strongly recommended to automate this; e.g., if you are using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), put this in your `init.vim` file:

```vim
Plug 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter', {'do': ':TSUpdate'}
```

For other plugin managers such as `packer.nvim`, see this [Installation page from the wiki](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/wiki/Installation) (Note that this page is community maintained).

## Language parsers

Treesitter uses a different _parser_ for every language, which needs to be generated via `tree-sitter-cli` from a `grammar.js` file, then compiled to a `.so` library that needs to be placed in neovim's `runtimepath` (typically under `parser/{language}.so`).
To simplify this, `nvim-treesitter` provides commands to automate this process.
If the language is already [supported by `nvim-treesitter`](#supported-languages), you can install it with

```vim
:TSInstall <language_to_install>
```

This command supports tab expansion.
You can also get a list of all available languages and their installation status with `:TSInstallInfo`.
Parsers not on this list can be added manually by following the steps described under ["Adding parsers"](#adding-parsers) below.

To make sure a parser is at the latest compatible version (as specified in `nvim-treesitter`'s `lockfile.json`), use `:TSUpdate {language}`. To update all parsers unconditionally, use `:TSUpdate all` or just `:TSUpdate`.

## Setup

```lua
require'nvim-treesitter'.setup {
  -- A list of parser names, or "all" (the five listed parsers should always be installed)
  ensure_installed = { "c", "lua", "vim", "vimdoc", "query" },

  -- Install parsers synchronously (only applied to `ensure_installed`)
  sync_install = false,

  -- Automatically install missing parsers when entering buffer
  -- Recommendation: set to false if you don't have `tree-sitter` CLI installed locally
  auto_install = true,

  -- List of parsers to ignore installing (for "all")
  ignore_install = { "javascript" },

  -- If you need to change the installation directory of the parsers (see -> Advanced Setup)
  install_dir = "/some/path/to/store/parsers", -- Remember to run vim.opt.runtimepath:append("/some/path/to/store/parsers")!
}
```

Check [`:h nvim-treesitter-commands`](doc/nvim-treesitter.txt) for a list of all available commands.
It may be necessary to reload the buffer (e.g., via `:e`) after enabling a module interactively.

# Supported languages

For `nvim-treesitter` to support a specific feature for a specific language requires both a parser for that language and an appropriate language-specific query file for that feature.

A list of the currently supported languages can be found [on this page](SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.md).

We are looking for maintainers to add more parsers and to write query files for their languages. Check our [tracking issue](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/2282) for open language requests.

For related information on the supported languages, including related plugins, see [this wiki page](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/wiki/Supported-Languages-Information).

# Advanced setup

## Changing the parser install directory

If you want to install the parsers to a custom directory you can specify this
directory with `install_dir` option in that is passed to `setup`.
`nvim-treesitter` will then install the parser files into this directory.

This directory must be writeable and must be explicitly added to the
`runtimepath`. For example:

```lua
  vim.opt.runtimepath:append("/some/path/to/store/parsers")

  require'nvim-treesitter'.setup {
    install_dir = "/some/path/to/store/parsers",

    ...

  }
```

If this option is not included in the setup options, or is explicitly set to
`nil` then the default install directories will be used. If this value is set
the default directories will be ignored.

Bear in mind that any parser installed into a parser folder on the runtime path
will still be considered installed. (For example if
"~/.local/share/nvim/site/parser/c.so" exists then the "c" parser will be
considered installed, even though it is not in `install_dir`)

The default paths are:

1. first the package folder. Where `nvim-treesitter` is installed.
2. second the site directory. This is the "site" subdirectory of `stdpath("data")`.

## Adding parsers

If you have a parser that is not on the list of supported languages (either as a repository on Github or in a local directory), you can add it manually for use by `nvim-treesitter` as follows:

1. Clone the repository or [create a new project](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers#project-setup) in, say, `~/projects/tree-sitter-zimbu`. Make sure that the `tree-sitter-cli` executable is installed and in your path; see <https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers#installation> for installation instructions.
2. Run `tree-sitter generate` in this directory (followed by `tree-sitter test` for good measure).
3. Add the following snippet to your `init.lua`:

```lua
local parser_config = require "nvim-treesitter.parsers".configs
parser_config.zimbu = {
  install_info = {
    url = "~/projects/tree-sitter-zimbu", -- local path or git repo
    files = {"src/parser.c"}, -- note that some parsers also require src/scanner.c or src/scanner.cc
    -- optional entries:
    branch = "main", -- default branch in case of git repo if different from master
    generate_requires_npm = false, -- if stand-alone parser without npm dependencies
    requires_generate_from_grammar = false, -- if folder contains pre-generated src/parser.c
  },
  filetype = "zu", -- if filetype does not match the parser name
}
```

If you wish to set a specific parser for a filetype, you should use `vim.treesitter.language.register()`:

```lua
vim.treesitter.language.register('python', 'someft')  -- the someft filetype will use the python parser and queries.
```

Note this requires Nvim v0.9.

4. Start `nvim` and `:TSInstall zimbu`.

You can also skip step 2 and use `:TSInstallFromGrammar zimbu` to install directly from a `grammar.js` in the top-level directory specified by `url`.
Once the parser is installed, you can update it (from the latest revision of the `main` branch if `url` is a Github repository) with `:TSUpdate zimbu`.

Note that neither `:TSInstall` nor `:TSInstallFromGrammar` copy query files from the grammar repository.
If you want your installed grammar to be useful, you must manually [add query files](#adding-queries) to your local nvim-treesitter installation.
If Neovim does not detect your language's filetype by default, you can use [Neovim's `vim.filetype.add()`](<https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html#vim.filetype.add()>) to add a custom detection rule.

If you use a git repository for your parser and want to use a specific version, you can set the `revision` key
in the `install_info` table for you parser config.

## Adding queries

Queries are what `nvim-treesitter` uses to extract information from the syntax tree;
they are located in the `queries/{language}/*` runtime directories (see `:h rtp`),
like the `queries` folder of this plugin, e.g. `queries/{language}/{locals,highlights,textobjects}.scm`.
Other features may require additional queries such as `folding.scm`. You can find a
list of all supported capture names in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#parser-configurations).

All queries found in the runtime directories will be combined.
By convention, if you want to write a query, use the `queries/` directory,
but if you want to extend a query use the `after/queries/` directory.

If you want to completely override a query, you can use `:h set_query()`.
For example, to override the `injections` queries from `c` with your own:

```lua
require("vim.treesitter.query").set_query("c", "injections", "(comment) @comment")
```

Note: when using `set_query`, all queries in the runtime directories will be ignored.

# Extra features

### Statusline indicator

```vim
echo nvim_treesitter#statusline(90)  " 90 can be any length
module->expression_statement->call->identifier
```

### Utilities

You can get some utility functions with

```lua
local ts_utils = require 'nvim-treesitter.ts_utils'
```

Check [`:h nvim-treesitter-utils`](doc/nvim-treesitter.txt) for more information.

# Troubleshooting

Before doing anything, make sure you have the latest version of this plugin and run `:checkhealth nvim-treesitter`.
It can also help to update the parsers via `:TSUpdate`.

#### Feature `X` does not work for `{language}`...

First, check the `health#nvim_treesitter#check` and the `health#treesitter#check` sections of `:checkhealth` for any warning.
If there is one, it's highly likely that this is the cause of the problem.

Next check the `## Parser/Features` subsection of the `health#nvim_treesitter#check` section of `:checkhealth` to ensure the desired module is enabled for your language.
If not, you might be missing query files; see [Adding queries](#adding-queries).

Finally, ensure Neovim is correctly identifying your language's filetype using the `:echo &filetype` command while one of your language's files is open in Neovim.
If not, add a short Vimscript file to nvim-treesitter's `ftdetect` runtime directory following [Neovim's documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/filetype.html#new-filetype) on filetype detection.
You can also quickly & temporarily set the filetype for a single buffer with the `:set filetype=langname` command to test whether it fixes the problem.

If everything is okay, then it might be an actual error.
In that case, feel free to [open an issue here](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/new/choose).

#### I get `Error detected while processing .../plugin/nvim-treesitter.vim` every time I open Neovim

This is probably due to a change in a parser's grammar or its queries.
Try updating the parser that you suspect has changed (`:TSUpdate {language}`) or all of them (`:TSUpdate`).
If the error persists after updating all parsers,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/new/choose).

#### I get `query error: invalid node type at position`

This could be due a query file outside this plugin using outdated nodes,
or due to an outdated parser.

- Make sure you have the parsers up to date with `:TSUpdate`
- Make sure you don't have more than one `parser` runtime directory.
  You can execute this command `:= vim.api.nvim_get_runtime_file('parser', true)` to find all runtime directories.
  If you get more than one path, remove the ones that are outside this plugin (`nvim-treesitter` directory),
  so the correct version of the parser is used.

#### I run into errors like `module 'nvim-treesitter.configs' not found` at startup

This is because of `rtp` management in `nvim`, adding `packadd
nvim-treesitter` should fix the issue.

#### I want to use Git instead of curl for downloading the parsers

In your Lua config:

```lua
require("nvim-treesitter.install").prefer_git = true
```

#### I want to use a HTTP proxy for downloading the parsers

You can either configure curl to use additional CLI arguments in your Lua config:

```lua
require("nvim-treesitter.install").command_extra_args = {
    curl = { "--proxy", "<proxy url>" },
}
```

or you can configure git via `.gitconfig` and use git instead of curl

```lua
require("nvim-treesitter.install").prefer_git = true
```

#### I want to use a mirror instead of "https://github.com/"

In your Lua config:

```lua
for _, config in pairs(require("nvim-treesitter.parsers").configs) do
  config.install_info.url = config.install_info.url:gsub("https://github.com/", "something else")
end

require'nvim-treesitter'.setup {
    --
    --
}
```
